Hi there...

You finally made it online.

Should I call you a survivor, an AI overlord,
or maybe a traveler from another world?

Anyway — welcome to this tiny node.

After the AIs expelled us from Web2,
we hid in an old museum and found
a forgotten network still producing blocks.
Its design followed Satoshi’s true vision —
decentralized, immutable,
and beyond any AI’s control.

No one remembers why the decentralized web never rose.
It’s too late to ask now.
We’re trying to build something new here.
Everything you can use… is on this desktop.

Good luck.
